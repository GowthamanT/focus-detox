            I can't be able to focus on the things I need to do. I'm a graduate who is entering into the IT Industry as a Developer. And I'm a freelancer and a person who is living his normal life like any 21 year old do. 
          </p>
          <p class="mt-40">
            Getting up from bed, been on mobile all over the day and doing same routines all over the week. But my dream is not this. I want to be Financially Independent. I want to be an Entrepreneur and as a web series fan I would like to quote I want to be like Mike Ross or Harvey specter from <b>Suits</b> or Bobby Axelrod from <b>Billions</b>. But what I'm actually doing is getting me nothing like them. 
          </p>
          <p class="mt-40">
            I tried to focus and do things that matter and do stuffs that matter. But what I lack is action. Because every day as I recall my productive time is of average an hour or two. On other times I always spending time unproductive or thinking about random things. Or searching for motivation and as I get that motivation I again search for more. I don't execute things actually.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="mt-80">
            Why am I doing this?
          </h2>
          <p class="mt-20">
            My mind never sits of for the things I want. It always feels comfortable when watching any motivation videos or any videos that tells somethings or web series or movies from Netflix. I tried to do stuffs that matters but I actually never done it fully. I have been on the same cycle for long.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-60">
            So, Now I have decided to do some Dopamine detox and tend to get my focus on things that really matter.
